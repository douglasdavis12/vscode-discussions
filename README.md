## Visual Studio Code Community Discussions

Community discussions is the place to discuss VS Code's extension platform, ask questions, help other members of the community, and get answers.

We are scoping discussions to just extension development to learn, experiment, and grow sustainably.

### We need your participation

‚Ä¶ to create a welcoming and inspiring community. [Microsoft's Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/) applies here, in short **please be kind and remember that there are real people on the other side of the keyboard.** 

Also:

- As we begin to build this community, we ask that you limit conversations to the categories available (more categories will be released as the community grows!)

- Before opening a new discussion, please search existing posts to see if the topic thread already exists.

- Please do not use this as a place to `@` your favorite VS Code contributor to get an extra bump on a feature request. Spoiler: it won't work.

Happy discussing! :)

### FAQ

**How can I help?**
Answer questions with empathy and kindness. Keep the community welcoming by giving contructive feedback and reporting unacceptable behavior. Reach out if you like to help with moderation.

**Why are there just categories for extension development?**
We want to start small, and the extension author community is just the right size. Meanwhile [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/visual-studio-code?tab=Newest) continues to serve most other questions.

**When will more categories be added?**
As we learn what works well, tweak our moderation process, and see the community grow before expanding topics. If we see moderation becoming a burden on the team we will also consider take action.
